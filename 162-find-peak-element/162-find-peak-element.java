// Consider an example  7 8 9 6 5 4 3 -->9 is the peak element
//  we get the nums[mid]==6 using binary search
// now we return this number if it is a peak otherwise we have to make a a decision as to which side to binary search(left side of mid or right side of mid)
// we check number nums[mid-1]
// if(nums[mid-1] > nums[mid]) it would make more sense to search in left side of mid
// because for nums[mid-1] to not be a peak there has to be a number greater than it to it's left
// this goes on until we encounter the largest element
// (worst case the largest element is the first element)
//therefore we are sure to get atleast one peak element to the left of mid in case nums[mid-1] > num[mid]
    
    //Time Complexity: O(log(n))
	//Space Complexity: O(1)
